# OpenMP-MPI-Hybrid-Parallel-Programming 


1. Worked on parallelizing three basic linear algebra algorithms.
2. Implemented them using two Parallel Programming approaches: Shared Memory Model (OpenMP) and Message Passing Interface (MPI).
3. Comparatively studied and provided insights on the performance of various parallelization approaches.
